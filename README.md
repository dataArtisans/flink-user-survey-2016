This repository contains anonymized / non-attributed response data from the 2016 Apache Flink User Survey. The survey was administered by data Artisans.

A summary of survey responses is available on the data Artisans blog. See:
* [Part 1](http://data-artisans.com/flink-user-survey-2016-part-1/)
* [Part 2](http://data-artisans.com/flink-user-survey-2016-part-2/)

In this repository, you'll find both:
* A PDF file with all graphs from the part 1 post. These graphs summarize answers to the survey's multiple choice questions.
* Text files with raw answers from users who gave us permission to share this data anonymously. We edited some of these responses for readability but otherwise did not modify them. Each bullet point represents a different response. We did not de-duplicate responses across users so that it's possible to see the frequency of a given response.
